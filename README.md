# Student_database
Student database - very unique and special project. It's my first ever "bigger" program made in 2018, Basics of Programming course in c++, University Of Science and Technology in Wroclaw.

Easiest way to run it: open whatever empty project on your PC, then copy-paste whole code nad run it.
